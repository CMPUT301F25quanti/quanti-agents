October 9th, 2025 - Thursday @ ETLC
Meeting notes

Team quanti met with project manager - Harshit, who gave us specifics of deliverables and how the project should go about. Few definitions too:

UI - Every Screen and description of what the screen is
Story board - includes all screens and how they're linked; how the app flows
Shows buttons and actions
Example - clicking login, takes the user to the login screen
Can potentially use figma

If can’t be implement in xml, gonna be tough work. Don’t have a UI that is too technical and unfeasible.

CRC cards part are relatively lower effort

Use github issues to document user responsibilities, follow agile

Project wiki - meeting notes
What was discussed
What went well
What to be improved
Any concerns

Meeting log is using markdown

Meetings without harshit
Not marked but do the same thing as above, what was discussed, any concerns, etc.

When one person pushes code, work does not seem to be distributed equally. Harshit only sees final commits. Therefore do equal commits, shows that multiple people worked together

For the final presentation, add something unique, maybe nicer ui, adding lottery drawing to google calendar, etc. Have good energy too.

When you commit, do proper commit messages, like dont just write “fixed!”

On Github issues, write “in progress” if you're working on something

Decide which user stories are gonna be finished for project part 3, at least 50%. Dont say 60 and do 50, will be docked marks if you overcommit and don’t deliver.

Harshit’s discord - reallyok

Use png formatting when submitting images from figma, don’t use links

Mark name of issue with the user story

Crc cards and user stories commits need to be equal among team members


Decided to meet next virtually on Friday evening - October 10th.
