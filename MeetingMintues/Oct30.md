## 2. Discussion Summary  

### Things mentioned by Harshit
- Give priority to the backend since there isn’t enough time to completely make a full-fledged “polished” XML. Can do that for the final part 4.  
- When writing code, write docs and test cases along with it, don’t wait until the end.  
- UI testing is not that comprehensive  
- Back end testing must be comprehensive  
- UML is almost done, just need to correct arrows instead of making everything general association by default.  
- Add a file on how to run the application. Harshit will clone the repo and the app will be run on his computer. Simple markdown file required on running instructions.  
- When submitting part 4, all additional screens must be reflected on storyboards, UI, and UML
